# CaveSurveyReports
App to collect [CaveSurvey](https://github.com/lz1asl/CaveSurvey) user error reports.
At some later point it could become a hub to backup or share surveys.

Deprecated since CaveSurvey 1.51.

Back-end written in Ruby on Rails and hosted at Heroku.

Great thanks to JetBrains for providing Open Source licenses for [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)!
